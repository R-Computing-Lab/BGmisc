\title{Create Data Frame for Generation}
\usage{
createGenDataFrame(sizeGens, genIndex, idGen)
}
\arguments{
\item{sizeGens}{A numeric vector containing the sizes of each generation within the pedigree.}

\item{genIndex}{An integer representing the current generation index for which the data frame is being created.}

\item{idGen}{A numeric vector containing the ID numbers to be assigned to individuals in the current generation.}
}
\value{
A data frame representing the initial structure for the individuals in the specified generation
        before any relationships (parental, spousal) are defined. The columns include family ID (`fam`),
        individual ID (`id`), generation number (`gen`), father's ID (`pat`), mother's ID (`mat`),
        spouse's ID (`spt`), and sex (`sex`), with NA values for paternal, maternal, and spouse IDs, and sex.
}
\description{
This function creates a data frame for a specific generation within the simulated pedigree.
It initializes the data frame with default values for family ID, individual ID, generation number,
paternal ID, maternal ID, spouse ID, and sex. All individuals are initially set with NA for paternal,
maternal, spouse IDs, and sex, awaiting further assignment.
}
\examples{
sizeGens <- c(3, 5, 4) # Example sizes for 3 generations
genIndex <- 2 # Creating data frame for the 2nd generation
idGen <- 101:105 # Example IDs for the 2nd generation
df_Ngen <- createGenDataFrame(sizeGens, genIndex, idGen)
print(df_Ngen)
