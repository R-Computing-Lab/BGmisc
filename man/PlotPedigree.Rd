A wrapped function to plot simulated pedigree from function \code{simulatePedigree}. This function require the installation of package \code{kinship2}.}
\usage{
plotPedigree(
  ped,
  code_male = NULL,
  quiet = TRUE,
  cex = 0.5,
  col = 1,
  symbolsize = 1,
  branch = 0.6,
  packed = TRUE,
  align = c(1.5, 2),
  width = 8,
  density = c(-1, 35, 65, 20),
  mar = c(2.1, 1, 2.1, 1),
  angle = c(90, 65, 40, 0),
  keep.par = FALSE,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{The simulated pedigree data.frame from function \code{simulatePedigree}. Or a pedigree dataframe with the same colnames as the dataframe simulated from function \code{simulatePedigree}.}

\item{code_male}{This optional input allows you to indicate what value in the sex variable codes for male.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If TRUE, suppresses the printing of the pedigree object. Default is TRUE.}

\item{cex}{The font size of the IDs for each individual in the plot.}

\item{col}{
color for each id.  Default assigns the same color to everyone.
}

\item{symbolsize}{
controls symbolsize. Default=1.
}

\item{branch}{
defines how much angle is used to connect various levels of nuclear families.
}

\item{packed}{
default=T.  If T, uniform distance between all individuals at a given level.
}

\item{align}{ these parameters control the extra effort spent trying to
  align children underneath parents, but without making the pedigree too
  wide.  Set to F to speed up plotting.
}

\item{width}{
default=8.  For a packed pedigree, the minimum width allowed in the
realignment of pedigrees.
}

\item{density}{
defines density used in the symbols.  Takes up to 4 different values.
}

\item{mar}{margin parmeters, as in the \code{par} function}

\item{angle}{
defines angle used in the symbols.  Takes up to 4 different values.
}

\item{keep.par}{
Default = F, allows user to keep the parameter settings the same as they
were for plotting (useful for adding extras to the plot)
}

\item{pconnect}{when connecting parent to children the program will try
  to make the connecting line as close to vertical as possible, subject
  to it lying inside the endpoints of the line that connects the
  children by at least \code{pconnect} people.  Setting this option
  to a large number will force the line to connect at the midpoint of
  the children.}

\item{...}{
Extra options that feed into the plot function.
}
}
\value{
A plot of the simulated pedigree
