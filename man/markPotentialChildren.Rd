}
\arguments{
\item{df_Ngen}{A data frame for the current generation being processed.
It must include columns for individual IDs (`id`), spouse IDs (`spID`), sex (`sex`),
and any previously assigned roles (`ifparent`, `ifson`, `ifdau`).}

\item{i}{Integer, the index of the current generation being processed.}

\item{Ngen}{Integer, the total number of generations in the simulation.}

\item{sizeGens}{Numeric vector, containing the size (number of individuals) of each generation.}

\item{CoupleF}{Integer scalar giving the number of distinct mating couples in the current
generation `i`. This is typically computed upstream from the spouse assignments
(e.g., as the number of unique non-missing spouse pairs in `df_Ngen`) and must satisfy
`0 <= CoupleF <= floor(sizeGens[i] / 2)`.}

\item{code_male}{The value to use for males. Default is "M"}

\item{code_female}{The value to use for females. Default is "F"}

\item{beta}{logical. If TRUE, use the optimized version of the algorithm.}
}
\value{
Modifies `df_Ngen` in place by updating or adding columns related to individual roles
        (`ifparent`, `ifson`, `ifdau`) and couple IDs (`coupleId`). The updated data frame is
        also returned for integration into the larger pedigree data frame (`df_Fam`).
}
\description{
This subfunction marks individuals in a generation as potential sons, daughters,
or parents based on their relationships and assigns unique couple IDs. It processes
the assignment of roles and relationships within and between generations in a pedigree simulation.
