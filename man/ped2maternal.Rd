\description{
Add a maternal line ID variable to a pedigree
}
\details{
Under various scenarios it is useful to know which people in a pedigree
belong to the same maternal lines.  This function first turns a pedigree
into a graph where adjacency is defined by mother-child relationships.
Subsequently, the weakly connected components algorithm finds all the
separate maternal lines and gives them an ID variable.
