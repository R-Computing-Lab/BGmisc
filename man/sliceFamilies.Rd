\arguments{
\item{outcome_name}{Name of the outcome variable (used for naming input/output files)}

\item{biggest}{Logical; whether to process the "biggest" family dataset (TRUE) or all-but-biggest (FALSE)}

\item{bin_width}{Width of additive relatedness bins (default is 0.10)}

\item{degreerelatedness}{Maximum degree of relatedness to consider (default 12)}

\item{chunk_size}{Number of lines to read in each chunk (default 2e7)}

\item{max_lines}{Max number of lines to process from input file (default 1e13)}

\item{input_file}{Path to the input CSV file. If NULL, defaults to a specific file based on `biggest` flag.}

\item{folder_prefix}{Prefix for the output folder (default "data")}

\item{progress_csv}{Path to a CSV file for tracking progress (default "progress.csv")}

\item{progress_status}{Path to a text file for logging progress status (default "progress.txt")}

\item{data_directory}{Directory where output files will be saved. If NULL, it is constructed based on `outcome_name` and `folder_prefix`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; whether to print progress messages (default FALSE)}

\item{file_column_names}{Names of the columns in the input file (default c("ID1", "ID2", "addRel", "mitRel", "cnuRel"))}
}
\value{
NULL. Writes CSV files to disk and updates progress logs.
}
\description{
Slices up families by additive relatedness, creating CSV files grouped by degree of relatedness.
Operates on a potentially large file by reading in chunks and binning links by additive relatedness.
