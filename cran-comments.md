Description
-----------------------------------------------

This update reflects a substantial improvement in the codebase as part of the peer review process for JOSS, including the addition of numerous function checks, increased code coverage to 85%, and the replacement of sapply usage. We also added a new function to simulate twins and the ability to trace paternal and maternal lines. We also added a Harry Potter pedigree.
