# Description

This update includes minor enhancements, a major update to the ASOIAF dataset, and rewritten vignettes to use ggpedigree.

I am also moving the lone plotting function from BGmisc to ggpedigree package. I maintain both packages. As promised, now that the ggpedigree package update is on CRAN, I am uploading the new version of BGmisc that does not include the plotting function.
