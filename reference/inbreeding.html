Different kinds of inbreeding occur in each extended family.
The types of inbreeding are as follows:

Extended Family 1: Sister wives - Children with the same father and different mothers who are sisters.
Extended Family 2: Full siblings have children.
Extended Family 3: Half siblings have children.
Extended Family 4: First cousins have children.
Extended Family 5: Father has child with his daughter.
Extended Family 6: Half sister wives - Children with the same father and different mothers who are half sisters.
Extended Family 7: Uncle-niece and Aunt-nephew have children.
Extended Family 8: A father-son pairs has children with a corresponding mother-daughter pair.


Although not all of the above structures are technically inbreeding, they aim to test pedigree diagramming and path tracing algorithms.  This dataset is not intended to represent any real individuals or families.
The variables are as follows:

ID:  Person identification variable
sex:  Sex of the ID: 1 is female; 0 is male
dadID:  ID of the father
momID:  ID of the mother
FamID:  ID of the extended family
Gen:  Generation of the person
proband:  Always FALSE
