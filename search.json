Within block, tags parsed using simple pattern matches: - Relationship tags FAMC (child) FAMS (spouse) collected later mapped parent IDs add_parents = TRUE. - Individuals defined blocks beginning lines containing @ INDI. block passed internal parser extracts identifiers, names, life events, attributes, family relationships. - Names parsed GEDCOM NAME tag, usually encodes given name surname slashes (e.g., \"NAME John /Smith/\"). parser extracts given name, surname, constructs cleaned full name. Additional name components (prefix, suffix, nickname, married surname) parsed present. - Life events recognized BIRT DEAT tags. Event details assumed occur fixed offsets block (example, BIRT tag followed DATE, PLAC, optionally geographic coordinates). Missing elements leave corresponding field NA. birth, expected lines DATE (+1), PLAC (+2), LATI (+4), LONG (+5); death, expected lines DATE (+1), PLAC (+2), CAUS (+3), LATI (+4), LONG (+5). - Attributes occupation, education, religion parsed directly GEDCOM tags (OCCU, EDUC, RELI, etc.). attribute stored dedicated column prefixed attribute_. - Relationships parsed FAMC (family child) FAMS (family spouse). identifiers preserved raw output can optionally mapped explicit parent IDs via processParents(). - Post-processing can applied setting post_process = TRUE. applies several clean-steps: adding inferred parents, merging duplicate name fields, slimming data frame removing -empty columns relationship tags.","code":""},{"path":"https://r-computing-lab.github.io/BGmisc/reference/readWikifamilytree.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Read Wiki Family Tree — readWikifamilytree","title":"Read Wiki Family Tree — readWikifamilytree","text":"Read Wiki Family Tree","code":""},{"path":"https://r-computing-lab.github.io/BGmisc/reference/readWikifamilytree.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Read Wiki Family Tree — readWikifamilytree","text":"","code":"readWikifamilytree(text = NULL, verbose = FALSE, file_path = NULL, ...)"},{"path":"https://r-computing-lab.github.io/BGmisc/reference/readWikifamilytree.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Read Wiki Family Tree — readWikifamilytree","text":"text character string containing text family tree wiki format. verbose logical value indicating whether print messages. file_path path file containing family tree. ...
